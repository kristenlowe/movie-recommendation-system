# Movie Recommendation System

This movie recommendation system learns user preferences (genre, runtime, release year) and recommends movies based on these preferences and the characteristics of the movies.
The movie data comes from the [TMDB 5000 Movies dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv).
